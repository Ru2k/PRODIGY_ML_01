I used the given datasets on kaggle.com (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview) to test and train this model.
This model can predict the prices of new and upcoming houses based on datasets of exisiting house details.I'm thankful to Prodigy Infotech for initiating my hands-on learning and apply everything I know.
I also wish to acknowledge the information I got from these resources.
